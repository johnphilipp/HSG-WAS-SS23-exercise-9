## Task 5

To counter Rogues' attacks, the Loyals could enhance trust calculations, increase their numbers, or adopt more adaptive behavior. For the Rogues to overpower the Loyals, they could increase their agent count as well, and adjust the trust calculation to better suit them for exmaple by giving more weight to witness and reputation scores.
